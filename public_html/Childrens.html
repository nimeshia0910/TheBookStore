                                            A petite trim size befits the content of this photo-illustrated book (the sixth Guinea Pig Classic), most likely to appeal to the niche market of guinea-pig owners. Text that retells the story of the famous ballet is accompanied by Beresford’s photographs of costumed guinea pigs on small stages set with dollhouse furniture and props (costumes and props courtesy of Newall). As the narrative describes Clara looking at her presents, a photo shows a guinea pig clad in a white dress and blue hair ribbon approaching a tiny, potted Christmas tree. Various incongruities between text and art arise, such as when “the big clock strikes twelve,” with Clara dwarfing a small, sparkly grandfather clock. Later, the Mouse King, described as a “terrifying figure,” looks anything but. It’s odd that the term “fandango” is the only non-English word to receive a footnoted definition; perhaps child readers will have no difficulty negotiating “relevé”? The photos of the costumed guinea pigs aren’t edited to make them appear to dance, which results in rather redundant tableaux of the fluffy creatures, often staring vacantly, sometimes with mouths agape. The backmatter names each guinea pig (including two Dorises), credits the roles they played, and provides background information on the ballet as well as pet rescue centers.
                                            Clearly a labor of love—and just as clearly limited in appeal. (Picture book. 4-7)

                                            Here, 14-year-old demigod Percy must find a way to thwart Kronos’s plan to reassemble his body and rally the evil forces of the underworld. 
                                            Percy, quest-partner Annabeth and mortal Rachel Elizabeth Dare enter the Labyrinth and encounter all manner of wondrous beings: the vampiric empousai, snaky dracaenae, Laistrygonian giants, Calypso, the Sphinx, a Hundred-Handed One, Hephaestus, Daedalus and Kronos himself, newly transformed. Riordan keeps Percy busy falling in love with Calypso, battling evil Antaeus, causing Mount St. Helens to erupt and finding the long-lost god Pan in a crystal cave in this romp that rivals Rowling for inventive, magical storytelling. The often-philosophical tale zips along with snappy dialogue, humor and thrilling action, culminating in a climactic battle between gods and Titans. This volume can stand alone, but no reader will be able to read just one. Look no further for the next Harry Potter; meet Percy Jackson, as legions of fans already have.f

                                            Chinese-born illustrator Guojing made her publishing debut in 2015 with The Only Child, a 112-page wordless book that won widespread acclaim and earned a spot on numerous best-of-the-year lists. Exploring an incident from her childhood, she delved into themes of being lost and lonely and finding one’s way home. Now, with Stormy, a wordless book about a homeless dog, Guojing has struck gold again as she explores similar themes with equal emotional resonance, albeit for a slightly younger audience.
                                            The story opens as an adorable, scruffy ball of fluff sleeps under a park bench. A young woman approaches, causing the pup to scamper off. The next day she brings a tennis ball, which the dog cautiously sniffs and finally takes. Guojing shows each move of the dog and woman in a series of moody graphic panels, highlighting the deserted, desolate landscape, the dog’s curiosity mixed with fear and the woman’s quiet patience until she finally leaves to go home. Next, a full-page illustration shows the dog sitting with the ball on a dark, cloudy night, his small, quivering body backlit by moonlight.
                                            On the next visit, the woman and dog actively play with the ball in a lively sequence of panels, and a full-spread illustration shows them gazing at each other from several yards apart, both gloriously backlit by the sun’s golden glow. They’ve made a connection, and in ensuing masterful scenes, Guojing shows how each tries to reach out to the other during the course of a wildly stormy night. Their efforts are, at first, unsuccessful, which makes their eventual reunion in the city all the more sweet.
                                            A master of both mood and lighting, Guojing proves once again that she’s an expert at translating her own heartfelt emotions to the page in a style that can only be described as beautifully cinematic. Deserving of worthy comparisons to wordless classics such as Raymond Briggs’ The Snowman and Chris Raschka’s A Ball for Daisy, Stormy is a timeless treasure.
