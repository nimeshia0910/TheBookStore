                                            In this debut mystery, famed detective Sherlock Holmes and partner Dr. Watson face a villain obsessed with procuring the recently discovered Marseille Nike.
                                            Sherlock Holmes receives a perfumed letter, written with disappearing ink, that piques his curiosity. It’s from Mlle. Emmeline La Victoire, alias Cherie Cerise, the “chanteuse extraordinaire” performing at the Chat Noir in Paris.
                                            Her young son, Emil, is missing. The Earl of Pellingham is Emil’s father, which coincides with Mycroft Holmes’ investigation into the earl’s affairs, including the deaths of four orphans.
                                            Accompanied by Dr. Watson, Sherlock travels to Paris, where they meet not only Mlle. La Victoire but her lover, the unscrupulous French detective Jean Vidocq.
                                            He is after information concerning the missing Nike statue. Later that evening, during Emmeline’s performance, a violent attack backstage forces the small group to find safety in the home of artist Henri Toulouse-Latrec, where Sherlock convinces Emmeline that Emil is hidden safely in England and to return with him to Baker Street.
                                            Mycroft will give Emmeline the address where Emil is hidden, provided Sherlock returns to Lancashire, impersonating art expert Fritz Prendergast, whom the earl has never seen, with Watson posing as Prendergast’s attending physician, Dr. Laurel. On the train to Lancashire, Sherlock sees a photograph of the dead children in a folder, and his resolve hardens.
                                            As the mystery deepens, MacBird skillfully interweaves fact with fiction while remaining faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original imagining of Sherlock Holmes, especially regarding his idiosyncrasies with both drug addiction and the recklessness he exhibits toward his own life, which could also be viewed as an addiction.
                                            She reinterprets his detective skills as being hereditary from the French side of his family, famous for its artists: “Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms,” Sherlock once said. “And so it was for him,” Watson says—“but his artistry went much deeper than that. In my view it was at the very root of his remarkable success as the world’s first consulting detective.”

                                            Scandal roils New York City in 1843 when Abraham Stowe, co-founder of the Women’s Medical College of Manhattan and cousin by marriage to Harriet Beecher Stowe, dies of poisoning. 
                                            His wife, Lena, stands trial for murdering him, supposedly in a jealous rage over his infidelities; Stowe himself had been accused of killing a young mistress in a botched abortion. 
                                            An idealistic 23-year-old reporter for the New York Aurora, one Walt Whitman, doesn’t believe either of the Stowes capable of those crimes.
                                            As their lodger and friend, he feels closer to them than to his parents. Despite all his efforts, however, Lena is convicted and hanged. With the help of his boss, Henry Saunders, who is also his tentative lover, Whitman dedicates himself to clearing her and her husband’s names.
                                            The Stowes had their enemies: anti-dissection protesters who try to destroy the college and opponents of Stowe’s latest draft of the Bone Bill, legislation that would have provided legal means for medical students to get cadavers for their research.
                                            Without that bill, body snatching remains a thriving industry in New York, and Walt suspects that one of the so-called resurrectionists could have killed Abraham. Henry helps Walt set a trap that leads to a powerfully connected body snatcher, Samuel Clements, and another murder that Walt witnesses.
                                            He escapes from Clements, but only just. As he digs more deeply into the past and present murders, wallows through the boss-run politics of New York City, and tries desperately to exonerate the Stowes, he realizes how dangerous an enemy he’s made.

                                            Simon Saddler, wool merchant and constable of the Stratford Corporation, was Shakespeare’s closest friend until he caught the Bard in bed with his wife, Peg.
                                            Although Will tells Simon on his deathbed that he’s been poisoned, Simon’s not disposed to believe him until after his death, when John Hall, Shakespeare’s physician and son-in-law, realizes that his symptoms were those of arsenic poisoning. 
                                            Although many in Stratford had reason to dislike the poet and playwright, Simon, thinking the answers may well lie in London, sets off after getting permission from the sheriff of Warwickshire.
                                            Once in London, Simon is immediately sucked into dangerous political intrigues, and attempts are made to kill him.
                                            He distrusts playwright Ben Jonson, who says he wants to help him, and soon becomes involved in the affairs of the mighty: the Earl of Southampton, the attorney general, the chief justice, and even King James. 
                                            Simon can’t help wondering if Shakespeare’s sudden recovery from financial difficulties is related to his death.
                                            Despite numerous attempts on his person, he continues to dig into matters that someone is willing to kill to keep hidden.
                                            In a departure from his well-known King Arthur series (The Stolen Bride, 2012, etc.), Hays pens an excellent mystery replete with historical detail, surely meant to have been the first in a series that sadly will be cut short by his recent death.
