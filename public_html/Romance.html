                                            At first glance, the couple is edgy but cute: Lily Bloom runs a flower shop for people who hate flowers; Ryle Kincaid is a surgeon who says he never wants to get married or have kids. They meet on a rooftop in Boston on the night Ryle loses a patient and Lily attends her abusive father’s funeral. The provocative opening takes a dark turn when Lily receives a warning about Ryle’s intentions from his sister, who becomes Lily’s employee and close friend. Lily swears she’ll never end up in another abusive home, but when Ryle starts to show all the same warning signs that her mother ignored, Lily learns just how hard it is to say goodbye. When Ryle is not in the throes of a jealous rage, his redeeming qualities return, and Lily can justify his behavior: “I think we needed what happened on the stairwell to happen so that I would know his past and we’d be able to work on it together,” she tells herself. Lily marries Ryle hoping the good will outweigh the bad, and the mother-daughter dynamics evolve beautifully as Lily reflects on her childhood with fresh eyes. Diary entries fancifully addressed to TV host Ellen DeGeneres serve as flashbacks to Lily’s teenage years, when she met her first love, Atlas Corrigan, a homeless boy she found squatting in a neighbor’s house. When Atlas turns up in Boston, now a successful chef, he begs Lily to leave Ryle. Despite the better option right in front of her, an unexpected complication forces Lily to cut ties with Atlas, confront Ryle, and try to end the cycle of abuse before it’s too late. The relationships are portrayed with compassion and honesty, and the author’s note at the end that explains Hoover’s personal connection to the subject matter is a must-read.
Packed with riveting drama and painful truths, this book powerfully illustrates the devastation of abuse—and the strength of the survivors.

                                            Our man in Waterloo proposes a marriage of convenience and ends up with much more.
                                        Suzanne Duval may be the Comtesse de Chambron but nevertheless, she’s making ends meet with piecework in a boardinghouse when Col. Simon Duval comes to find her.
                                        Simon, her late husband’s second cousin, has returned from his service as a spy in the Napoleonic wars and has sought her out to propose marriage. 
                                        Suzanne and Simon met years ago and had a “teasing friendship,” so it’s no surprise that they take quick interest in one another.
                                        But Suzanne, whom readers of the Rogues Redeemed series (Once a Scoundrel, 2018, etc.) will recognize from previous volumes, is traumatized by the abuse she suffered in a harem for many years. 
                                        Simon, who understands the "death of desire," proposes a marriage solely of companionship, and Suzanne accepts.
                                        As they begin their adventure-filled marriage together, traveling the Continent in the brief lull of the Napoleonic wars, Simon’s lust begins to reignite, and Suzanne is unsure whether she will be able to reciprocate his passion.
                                        But just as she begins to become more comfortable with Simon, Napoleon comes back from his exile, and soon the newlyweds are en route to a little town called Waterloo. As ever, Putney’s characters find themselves in mortal peril more than once as their love slowly blooms. 
                                        Unfortunately, this developing romance is often undermined by several subplots, copious historical detail, and cameos from earlier entries in the series, and it’s burdened with a lot of unnecessary exposition.
                                        Readers who will be uncomfortable reading about a heroine struggling with PTSD–like symptoms related to sexual assault may need to skip this one. Suzanne does find her way toward healing and enjoying sex, and although this happens more quickly than some might expect, Simon’s tenderness with her makes it more believable.
                                        Fans of the series will likely enjoy this new entry, but it will be hit or miss for other historical romance readers.

                                            endures too much in between." Wanted for her money, a woman holds out for love in the third book in the Spinster Heiresses series (A Match Made in Bed, 2018, etc.).
Matthew Addison is a duke without an inheritance. His family fortune has been steadily dwindling ever since a blackmailer discovered a shocking family secret. Willa Reverly is an heiress without a title, and after three unsuccessful seasons, she’s in danger of remaining a spinster. Their pending marriage will be a love match, if what they love is money. But after reading a book of poems Matt wrote for his estranged mistress, Willa decides she will settle for nothing less than the feelings that inspired him to write such tender words. She jilts Matt the day before their wedding, forcing him to try to win her heart for real. Though Matt is reluctant to fall in love again, he can’t deny his attraction to Willa and rises quickly to the challenge, and they reschedule their nuptials. But after a disastrous wedding night, he has an even harder time earning her trust—and when the blackmailer returns, he might lose her for good. The historical details are thought-provoking: In the Regency-era setting, the couple doesn’t expect to marry for love, and an affair is only shocking when the lovers are of the same sex, a topic that’s handled with care. But the topic of consent is treated unevenly. At first, Matt, who towers over his tiny bride, takes his time to make her comfortable. But when she asks him to stop, he doesn’t. Then he denies his humiliated bride her privacy, even to take a bath and use the chamber pot. When he takes a step back and proves he can control his urges, their love blossoms to great effect. But although Willa changes her mind about him, readers might not.
The story begins and ends with a swoon, but the headstrong heroine endures too much in between.
