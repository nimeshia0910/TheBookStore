                                            Steel (Until the End of Time, 2013, etc.) returns with her latest romance. Blaise McCarthy is our heroine. With huge green eyes, red hair, fine features and a fantastic figure, Blaise could easily pass for a woman in her 30s, even though she is practically pushing 50. With stark exposition, Steel outlines a life littered with romantic troubles. Her first husband, a cameraman, died while covering news from an unspecified war zone; her second husband, a venture capitalist 22 years her senior, gave her a beloved daughter, but they soon drifted apart from each other; her next serious relationship crashed and burned when she discovered that charming Andrew Weyland had no intention of ever divorcing his wife. Luckily, her daughter, Salima, thoughtfully understands that Blaise’s job as a renowned television journalist must take precedence over time together. Blinded by juvenile diabetes, Salima still lives with a personal caregiver on the grounds of the Caldwell School in Massachusetts. It’s a perfect life, if you disregard the loneliness of coming home to an empty apartment and limiting love to dinner dates with billionaire Saudi oil executives. It’s a perfect life until Salima’s caregiver dies, the Caldwell school is shut down under quarantine, and Salima is sent home with Simon, her gorgeous, new, very male caregiver. And then there’s the arrival of Susie Quentin, the beautiful, younger new anchor jockeying for Blaise’s job. Forced to take Salima and Simon into her home, Blaise must not only endure disruptions to her routine, but also face the fact that she is strongly attracted to Simon. But could he possibly want an older woman who may not be able to give him the family he wants?
                                            The novel’s predictability will likely delight Steel’s die-hard fans, but it won’t win any new ones.

                                            After her husband died, leaving her to raise Eve alone, what more could happen? Years later, Sylvie has a good life. Her daughter Eve will head off to college soon, and her second husband, Mark, may be ready to settle down into a sales manager position. While life with Jonathan brimmed with the glow of young love, life with Mark rings with a secure love. Maybe it’s Mark’s traveling that has kept their love life sparking after 11 years—years that have seen other marriages fail. Yet all is not well, not well at all, in Eve’s life. Struggling to hide her worsening eating disorder, not to mention her secret second Facebook account, Eve’s once-close relationship with Sylvie is deteriorating. One fateful weekend, Eve goes to an all-girls party in New York City, where she meets a kindred spirit, Grace, and the two girls swiftly abandon the others to their partying. Grace takes Eve home, where she meets Chris, Grace’s older brother, who is instantly attracted to her. Grace’s mother, Maggie, is a perfectionist (even her husband calls her the General), who has adopted a posh accent and posted rules throughout the opulent house. And it is there, in Maggie’s lovely Connecticut home, that Eve sees a photograph that will ruin two families. Riddled with coincidences and unlikely secrets, Green’s (Another Piece of My Heart, 2012, etc.) latest still manages to explore complex family dynamics with warmth.

                                            Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre may seem a fairly innocuous choice for a graphic-novel adaption, but Corzine proves otherwise.
                                            Eschewing much of the mystery of Thornfield Hall and trauma of Jane's early life, she opts to focus on the brooding romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. 
                                            An admirable intention, but one made, perhaps, without the audience in mind; the stodgy Victorian courtship isn't likely to rivet young teens.
                                            Worse yet, this version wastes the thrill and suspense of the "madwoman in the attic" subplot, thereby neutering one of the book's most memorable story lines and losing the opportunity to depict high-octane action scenes shrouded in eerie mystery.
                                            The illustrations are, save for a few wan action sequences, unremarkable though proficient enough. The text is mostly dialogue, with scarcely any action, resulting in endless panels of characters looking longingly, sadly or angrily at one another.
                                            The glossary is patently ridiculous, with age-inappropriate entries like "forgive" and "nightmare," and a biography of the author, while informative, is written in such stiff language as to turn young readers off altogether.
